# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint of a user interface. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality without detailed design elements.

## Why Wireframing Matters
Wireframes help teams align on design goals, identify usability issues early, and streamline development. They serve as a communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders.

## Role in the Design Process
Wireframes guide the transition from concept to prototype, ensuring that user needs are addressed before any code is written.
